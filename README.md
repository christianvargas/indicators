# Indicators

Example of a Backbone/Marionette CRUD module - part of a much larger application. 

### Notes
Normally the data would be coming from a RESTful API but they are currently not public so for the purposes of this demo, I simply initialized the data and used Local Storage. Also, in production I would use dependency managers like Bower and RequireJS, as well as keep the templates in separate files. Kept it simple just to focus on the MVC approach.

### Screenshots
Below are screenshots of the actual production system.
